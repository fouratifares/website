Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in machine learning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), within the [CEMSE](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/) division, co-advised by Prof. [Mohamed-Slim Alouini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HqIyyXcAAAAJ&hl=en) from KAUST and Prof. [Vaneet Aggarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tu4lmGwAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). 

My research centers around reinforcement learning, bandits, and neural networks, with a commitment to exploring intelligence and contributing to the advancement of AI.
I have published a sequence of works at top AI venues such as ICML, AAAI, and AISTATS. 

<p style="color:blue;"><i>I was awarded the KAUST CEMSE Dean's List Award in both <strong>2024</strong> and <strong>2025</strong> for outstanding academic progress.</i></p>


In 2022, I obtained my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KAUST. In 2020, I earned my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Multidisciplinary Engineering from the [Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia_Polytechnic_School), which I joined in 2017 after ranking in the top 1% in the Tunisian national Mathematics and Physics contest.
