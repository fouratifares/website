Welcome! 

I am Fares Fourati, a Ph.D. candidate in machine learning at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology). After ranking among the top 1% in Tunisia’s national entrance exam for engineering schools, I joined [École Polytechnique de Tunisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia_Polytechnic_School), where I earned my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Multidisciplinary Engineering in 2020. I then pursued my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at KAUST, graduating in 2022.

My research focuses on advancing machine learning, with interests spanning reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits, global optimization, submodular maximization, large language models, federated learning, and deep learning. I am driven by a deep curiosity about intelligence, both human and artificial, and a passion for shaping the next generation of AI technologies.

I have published in top conferences such as ICML, AAAI, and AISTATS. Beyond research, I enjoy teaching AI and machine learning courses and mentoring students on AI-driven projects.

My work has been recognized through multiple awards and distinctions. During my Ph.D., I was named to the CEMSE Dean’s List at KAUST for two consecutive years (2023/2024 and 2024/2025). I also won first place at the ACM-SIAM Student Competition (2024), was recognized as a KAUST AI Rising Star (2023), and secured first place at the Marconi Society’s Connectivity Summit (2021). Additionally, I hold the title of Kaggle Competitions Expert (2020).
