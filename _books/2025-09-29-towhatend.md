## Abstract 

Artificial intelligence is no longer a distant possibility, it is already reshaping how we live, think, and dream. But beyond its power and promise lies the deeper question: To what end?

In this thought-provoking book, researcher Fares Fourati reflects on the rise of AI not as a technical manual, but as a meditation on meaning, purpose, and the future of intelligence itself. Blending science, philosophy, and poetry, he explores questions at the edge of human and machine:

What does it mean to be intelligent?

Will AI redefine what it means to be human or reveal it more clearly?

Can we live alongside minds that surpass our own?

Is AI our mirror, our successor, or something else entirely?

Structured as a series of lyrical meditations, To What End? moves from the origins of questioning to the inevitability of superintelligence, through encounters with fear, faith, embodiment, meaning, and joy. It is not a manifesto or a prediction, but an invitation to reflection, for skeptics, dreamers, engineers, scientists, and all who stand at the dawn of the next intelligence.

If you are curious about the philosophical heart of artificial intelligence, its risks, its beauty, its potential, and its mystery, this book will stay with you long after the last page.
